\section{The Method of Maximum Likelihood}

\label{subsec:chi2}
\subsection{The $\chi^2$ Fit}
The simplest implementation of a fitting algorithm begins with an assumption of the true and observed distributions.
Namely, that the observed number of events in each bin of the histogram is drawn from a distribution approximately Gaussian with a mean $\mu$ equal to the expectation from simulations and a variance $\sigma^2$ calculated from the Poisson uncertainty on the expectation. 

\begin{equation}
	P\left(x|\mu\right) = N e^{\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(x-\mu\right)^2}{\sigma^2}}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is a normalization constant and, in the case of Poissonian statistics of simple histograms, the variance is given by the event weights in the specified bin.

\begin{equation}
	\sigma^2 = \mu = \sum{w}
\end{equation}

From this point, taking the logrithm yields the standard $\chi^2$ definition for the likelihood.

\begin{equation}
	LLH = Log_e(N) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(x-\mu\right)^2}{\mu}\right)
\end{equation}	



\label{subsec:finite_stats}
\subsection{Finite Statistics}
The $\chi^2$ distribution above implicitly assumes that the dominant source of uncertainty at the best-fit point comes from the statistical fluctuations of the data around the true distribution represented by the Monte Carlo simulation.
While this is true in te ideal case, in practice the statistical properties of the simulation sets themselves cannot be ignored.
In general, every attempt should be made to ensure the statistical fluctuations of the simulation sets are negligible compared to those of the data.
This typically leads to requests for at least an order of magnitude larger simulation statistics than expected from the data itself.

In the situation where this is infeasible, modifications to the likelihood space itself may be used to account for the additional uncertainties.
For this analysis the statistical uncertainties of the underlying simulation sets are added to the weighted uncertainties in quadrature.

\begin{equation}
	LLH = Log_e(N) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(x-\mu\right)^2}{\sum{\left(w\right)}^2 + \sum{w^2}\right)
\end{equation}
