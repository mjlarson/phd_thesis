\section{Event Building}
\subsection{The Simple Majority Triggers}

In DeepCore, the desire for lower energy events led to the introduction of a separate trigger, known as \emph{SMT3}.
This trigger, using only DOMs within the DeepCore fiducial volume, searches for at least three HLC launches occuring within 2.5 microseconds.
This effectively lowers the triggering threshold from roughly 100 GeV with the larger IceCube array to approximately 10 GeV.

\subsection{Global Triggers}
Once all triggers are identified, a \emph{global trigger} is defined. 
This consists of the superset of all triggers occurring within 10 microseconds (?) of one another.
All detector readout enclosed within the global trigger as well as additional information within 10 microseconds both before and after the trigger is combined into a single \emph{event}.
