\section{Neutrinos}
In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in uranium \cite{Becquerel}.
Measurements over the following decades showed various types of nuclear decays based on the penetration depth of the ionizing emissions [rutherford?].
Measurements of one type of radioactivity, the beta decays, over the following 30 years showed that the production of two observed particles from one parent nucleus: a daughter nucleus and an outgoing electron.
A single body decay of this type produces a simple spectrum due to conservation of energy and momentum.
Indeed, the energy of the daughter nucleus and the electron are completely determined by these two conditions, leading to a narrow line emission spectrum.

Contrary to expectations, however, the measurement of energies of the two resulting particles showed wide, continuous spectra \cite{Chadwick}. 
The spectrum provided a major puzzle for physicists due to the contradition with the simple theoretical expectations.
A conundrum for many years, one possible solution was suggested in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli.
In his letter, Pauli suggested that the conservation of energy and momentum could be saved if '... there could exist in the nuclei electrically neutral particles... which have spin 1/2 and obey the exclusion principle, and additionally different from light quanta in that they do not travel with the velocity of light' \cite{Pauli-Nu}.
The solution to the beta decay puzzle was, then, that this additional 'neutron' particle was emitted simultaneously with the observed daughter particles.
The resulting spectrum of the observed particles could then be continuous, as verified experimentally.
\improvement{may want to include a plot of the beta spectrum}

Pauli's suggestion provided a way to save the beloved conservation laws in physics, but at the expense of the assumption of a new particle.
The particle, called the 'neutron' in Pauli's letter and later renamed the 'neutrino' by Fermi, was proposed to be electrically neutral and, therefore, completely undetectable at the time.

It was not until nearly 20 years later, in 1956, that this mystery particle was first detected \cite{Cowan-Reines}. 
In a groundbreaking work, Cowen and Reines presented an experiment at the Savannah River Plant demonstrating detection of the neutrino.
The experiment, made up of layers of scintillation detectors around polyethelene boxes, yielded a signal-to-background rate of about 3 to 1 with a rate of 2.88 $\pm$ 0.22 counts/hour with a total livetime of 1371 hours, including time during which the nearby nuclear reator was offline.
For the discovery of the first neutrinos, Frederick Reines was granted a shared Nobel Prize in Physics for the year 1995 \cite{NobelPrize:1995-Reines}.

The experiment at the Savannah River Plant conclusively demonstrated the observation of neutrino events. 
Not long after, however, additional wrinkles in the story of the neutrinos emerged.
In 1962, an experiment performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory reported a new type of event: a neutrino candidate that produced only muons \cite{Danby-NuMu}, a new species of lepton discovered earlier that shared some properties with electrons, but with larger masses \cite{Neddermeyer-Muon}.
The neutrinos observed by Cowen and Reines interacted via inverse beta decay, producing the beta particle, now known to be an electron, in the process.
The observed neutrinos at Brookhaven, however, produced only muons.
These neutrinos appeared to produce no electrons in the interaction, indicating that a second kind of neutrino had been discovered.

For many years, the two neutrinos, dubbed the electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) and muon neutrino ($\nu_\mu$) due to their interactions with electrons and muons respectively, were studied in some detail. 
It wasn't until a series of experiments in the 1970s that significant information about the neutrinos again emerged.
Measurements at SLAC by Martin Perl and colleagues in 1974 and 1977 using a then-new $\mathtt{e^+ - e^-}$ collider showed anomolous events \cite{Perl-Tau}.
Conservation of energy and momentum once again appeared to be violated in reactions of the form 

\begin{equation}
	e^++e^- \rightarrow e^{\pm} + \mu^{\mp} + \mathtt{undetected particles}
\end{equation}

In order for the conservation laws to hold, two additional particles were required.
These particles would possess higher masses than the then-known electron and muon particles, but with an identical charge.
Perl suggested that the new particle, dubbed the tau lepton, could explain the result.

With the addition of a new charged lepton, theorists immediately predicted a third neutrino as well.
The new tau neutrino, $\nu_\tau$ remained solely a theoretical prediction until 2004, when the DONuT (\textbf{D}irect \textbf{O}bservation of \textbf{N}u-\textbf{T}au) collaboration published their first results.
In the initial paper, the DONuT experiment identified 4 candidate tau neutrino events with an estimated background of 0.34 events \cite{DONUT-2001}.
A total of 9 events were detected by the DONuT collaboration between 1997 and 2007, when the experiment ended \cite{DONUT-2007}.

Searches for additional neutrinos beyond the discovered three have been performed.
The cross section of the Z boson decaying to hadrons, for instance, is affected by the number of active, light neutrino species.
A precision measurement of the Z resonance completed at the LEP coillider demonstrated the existance of exactly three neutrinos \cite{ALEPH-3Nu}.

\label{sec:cosmic_rays}
\section{Cosmic Rays}
In the early years of the 20th century, scientists began investigating previously-unknown ionizing radiation in the atmosphere.
Scientists using electroscopes, early instruments designed to measure electric charge and radiation, discovered low levels of radiation in the air.
This new radiation was observed to be reduced when the electroscope was shielded by metal free of radioactivity, indicating that the signal was not an artifact of the detector itself and was, instead, coming from an external source.

Following just a few decades after the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel, many scientists believed that the electroscope was picking up radiation from the Earth itself.
The rate would be expected to decrease with increasing altitude above sea level and, to increase with increasing depth in the sea.
Early measurements by Domenico Pacini in 1910 showed that the radiation rate decreased by 20\% at a depth of 3 meters underwater compared to the rate at the surface \cite{Pacini-CRSource}, implying an origin independent of the Earth's crust.
Measurements were performed with electroscopes by Victor Franz Hess in 1912 tested the rate of ionizing radiation up to an altitude of 5 km \cite{Hoerandel-CRHistory}.
Hess showed that the observed rate decreased until an altitude of around 1 km, but at a slower rate than expected from theory.
Above 1400 meters, however, the rate of ionizing radiation increased again, rising substantially up to the maximum altitude reached at 5300 meters \cite{Compton-CRAltitude}.
Hess's work, later confirmed by Henri Millikin, showed definitively that there exists a source of radiation of extraterrestrial origin, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1936 \cite{NobelPrize:1936-Hess}.
This radiation was later dubbed "cosmic rays" by Millikan in reference to their extraterrestrial origin.

Work on cosmic rays has lead to numerous discoveries.
In 1937, for example, scientists working at an altitude of 2300 meters above sea level using photographic plates to study cosmic rays discovered interactions labeled "stars" \cite{Blau-HadronicShowers}. 
These "stars" showed multiple outgoing particles from a single vertex.
Further work on these types of events lead to the discovery of hadronic interactions, paving the way for the use of photographic emulsions in the study of particle physics.

In 1929, Bothe and Kolhoerster introduced the coincidence technique in which two or more detectors could be read out only when all participating detectors detect signals \cite{Kolhoerster-CoincidenceDetectors}.
The dawn of coicidence counters led to the remarkable observation that cosmic rays had a considerably larger extent than expected.
While the original objective was to determine the random coincidence rate between two counters, the coupled Geiger-Mueller counters showed coupled behavior out to a distance of at least 75 meters.
Work by Pierre Auger later confirmed the findings of Kolhoerster \findref{P. Auger et al., Comptes renduz 206, 1721 (1938)}.

Instead of consisting of single particles reaching detectors, Kolhoerster showed that the detected particles were due to extended air showers originating from cosmic ray interactions high in the atmosphere.
These showers begin with a cosmic ray primary particle, often a single proton accelerated to high energies, which interacts with particles of the Earth's atmosphere.
The interaction leads to the creation of various daughters, including neutrinos, muons, pions, kaons, and other hadrons.

Modern measurements have shown that the cosmic ray spectrum primarily consists of protons with a small contribution from helium and heavier elements \cite{PDG-2015}
These ions are accelerated in unknown astrophysical sources up to extremely high energies.
The cosmic ray spectrum extends over many orders of magnitude, with the highest energy observations reaching $\mathtt{10^{20}}$ electronvolts - far higher than any Earth-based accelerator.
The spectrum has multiple features that are believed to arise from different accelerator sources at different scales.

\section{The Standard Model}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.png}
\label{fig:standard_model}
\caption{The Standard Model of particle physics is made up of charged and uncharged leptons, quarks, and the various bosons. Image taken from \cite{StandardModel-Image}}
\end{figure}

These particles form just a small part of the Standard Model of particle physics.
The Standard Model consists of six quarks (up, down, strange, charm bottom, and top), three charged leptons (electron, muon, tau), three uncharged leptons (electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino), and the five bosons related to interactions (photon, Z, W, gluon, and Higgs).
Combinations of the quarks lead to various hadrons, paticles which interact with and are formed via the strong force, with different combinations of quarks and anti-quarks producing a wide variety of particles.
The Standard Model, developed over the last half century, elegantly encapulates the range of phenomena known to occur in particle physics and has been verified repeatedly over decades by many experiments.
Predictions of the Standard Model have been carefully verified by accelerator experiments, yielding precise checks on a wide range of parameters.

The three charged leptons and neutrinos form three 'families' or 'flavors'. 
Each charged lepton posseses a coupled neutrino which shares a lepton number conserved in interactions.
The electron, the lightest of the charged leptons at 511 KeV \cite{PDG-2015}, is a key ingredient of the atoms that make up the world, forming the basis for all of chemistry and is the only stable charged lepton.
The muon, with a mass of 105.7 MeV, is the middle of the three charged leptons, often appearing in particle interactions accompanied by the muon neutrino.
The muon has a relatively long livetime of 2.197 microseconds, far longer than many unstable hadrons.
The tau lepton is the heavies of the leptons, and with a mass of 1.777 GeV, it is heavier than the proton and appears only in relatively high energy interactions.
The tau has an extremely short lifetime, at 290.6 femtoseconds, and a rich variety of decay products.
This extremely short lifetime and high mass make the tau difficult to produce and study.

For the purposes of this work, the most significant parts of the Standard model are the neutrinos, which will be defined to be signal events; the up and down quarks, which will make up the protons and neutrinos upon which the neutrinos will interact; the W and Z bosons, which mediate the weak interactions via which the neutrinos may be observed; and the photon, which gives a method of observation of the interactions.

\label{subsec:interactions}
\subsection{Neutrino Interactions}
In the Standard Model, neutrinos are assumed to be massless, left-handed spin-1/2 leptons which interact solely via the weak force.
Two basic Feynman diagrams, shown in \ref{fig:nu_vertex}, may be used to represent the interaction verticies.

\begin{figure}

}; \\ 
\end{tabular}
\label{fig:nu_vertex}
\caption{Feynman diagrams showing the interaction vertex of the neutrino with the W and Z boson}
\end{figure}

From these two vertices, the various interactions relevent for this work may be derived.
There exist three important interactions for neutrinos in the energy range used in this work: the quasi-elastic, resonant, and deep inelastic interactions \cite{Formaggio-Xsec}.
Each occurs at different energies, as shown in \needfig{nu xsec plot with qe, res, dis}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Quasi-Elastic and Resonant Interactions}
At low energies of approximately 100 MeV to around 2 GeV, the neutrinos interact via \textbf{quasi-elastic scattering} (\textbf{QE}) interactions.
In the QE interaction, the neutrino scatters off an entire nucleon instead of the individual quarks.
In a charged current QE neutrino (anti-neutrino) interaction, the target neutron (proton) is converted to a proton (neutron) while the neutrino is converted to a charged lepton.

The cross section for QE interactions depends on various nuclear form factors that must be fit to experimental data.
Many of these form factors may be fit to electron scattering data, leaving only the axial vector nuclear form factors to be measured in the neutrino sector \findref{formaggio xsec}.
This form factor is normally assumed to have a dipole form 

\begin{equation}
F_A\left(Q^2\right) = \frac{g_A}{\left(1+\frac{Q^2}{M_A^2}\right)^2}
\label{eq:axial_mass_eq}
\end{equation}

where $\mathtt{g_A}$ is a constant fit to experimental data, $\mathtt{Q^2}$ is the 4-momentum transferred in the interaction, and $\mathtt{M_A}$ is known as the "axial mass".
This last term is fit to experimental data with a value of $\mathtt{M_A = 0.999 \pm 0.011}$ GeV \findref{formaggio}.

\textbf{Resonant scattering} interactions (\textbf{RES}), which result in the excitation of a nucleon followed by decay via emission of (typically) pions, occur for neutrinos of slightly higher energies of around 500 MeV to 10 GeV.
Resonant interactions are modeled in a similar way as the quasi-elastic interactions, with an associated axial mass term used to describe nuclear uncertainties.

\subsubsection{Deep Inelastic Interactions}
Above a few GeV, the neutrino cross section rises approximatley linearly and is dominated by \textbf{deep inelastic scattering} (\textbf{DIS}) interactions.
In DIS events, the exchange of the Z or W boson probes the internal structure of the nucleons.
This results in disruption of the nucleon and the larger nucleus.
The daughter particles form what is known as a \textbf{hadronic shower}.

\section{Methods of Detection}
Neutrinos may be detected if you're very very careful and don't scare them too badly.
