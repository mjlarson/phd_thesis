\chapter{Simulation of the IceCube-DeepCore Detector}
In order to model both signal and background, \emph{Monte Carlo simulations} of the detector are necessary. 
In the search for tau neutrinos, this is particularly important due to the low rates and high backgrounds expected, requiring multiple types of simulation for both signal and background.

Simulation in IceCube is broken into three broad stages, each of which will be discussed in turn.
The generators, discussed in Section~\ref{se
