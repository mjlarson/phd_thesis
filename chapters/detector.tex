\chapter{The IceCube Detector}
The low cross section of neutrinos is a challenge for experimentalists.
There exist two avenues for the meausrement of neutrinos.
The precise measurements of individual events, used most notably in the OPERA \cite{Description-OPERA} and DONUT \cite{DONUT-2001} to identify individual events, gives unique constraining power with low backgrounds.
More common, however, is the use of large experimental volumes to collect high-statistics neutrino samples.
For the study of atmospheric neutrinos, volumes on the order of a kiloton are required. 

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is currently the largest neutrino detector in the world, encompassing a volume of 1 km$^3$ of glacial ice at the geographic south pole.
The design of the IceCube detector is also presented in this chapter, beginning with a description of the DOMs that make up the primary detectors within the IceCube observatory (Section~\ref{sec:dom}).
The overall geometry of the detector is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:geometry} with a focus on the differences between the larger IceCube detector and the DeepCore subarray used for oscilation searches.
