\chapter{Neutrino Oscillations}
The search for oscillation events requires an explanation of neutrino oscillations.
The theory of neutrino oscillations is included here with broad descriptions of oscillations in vacuum (Section~\ref{subsec:vacuum}) and in matter (Section~\ref{subsec:msw}). 
Experimental evidence for the neutrino oscillations and current constraints on the oscillation parameters is presented in Section~\ref{sec:oscillation_constraints}.
Finally, a description of unitarity in the PMNS mixing matrix is given in Section~\ref{sec:unitarity} with particular emphasis placed on the search for additional neutrino flavors (Section~\ref{subsec:steriles}).
The motivation for this thesis as well as the purpose behind joint fits between appearance and disappearance data is discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:steriles_unitarity}.
