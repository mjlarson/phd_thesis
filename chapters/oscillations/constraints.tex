\subsection{Global Fits to Oscillations}
Since the initial discoveries of SNO and Super-K, many experiments have measured neutrino oscillations. 
Global fits are performed and updated regularly \cite{NuFit_2.2, NuFit.org}.

The most recent results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nufit_v32} and include information from solar, reactor, and atmospheric oscillation experiments.
The results explicitly assume unitarity and three neutrino species.
